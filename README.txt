 Two-Sided Slider

 Description

* Consists of a horizontal slider and a vertical slider (each edits a separate parameter)
*Sliders are perpendicular to each other, creating a plus-shape
*The thumb knob can slide both horizontally and vertically, allowing the user to edit two parameters instead of one 

*Useful for two closely related parameters 
*Quicker and easier for the user to adjust multiple parameters
* Can be implemented programmatically or using a nib.
* Made using Core Graphics; easy to customize.

 Contributing

* Feel free to contribute;  this project can be improved in many ways. (Polishing the graphics, allowing the user to manually change the parameters, etc)
